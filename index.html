    <h2>My Experience With Being In A Fraternity</h2>

    <p>Initially, when it came to joining a fraternity, I felt off due to the stereotype surrounding fraternities. Seeing videos on TikTok or Instagram, showing rude and immature college students that didn't seem to be a crowd I would like to be around. However, the fraternity that I decided to join was an outlier from those cases. I take on a bigger role in my fraternity as the Social Chair, handling setting up parties in whichever way I must, whether that's picking the theme, or simply when the party may start. While I may have never expected it, I currently live inside the fraternity, and in contrast to other fraternities on campus, I actually have my own room rather than sharing it with another person. With the number of people living in it, you may think that it would be impossible to fall asleep at night. Thankfully, I'm more of a late sleeper, so by the time I go to bed, everyone is already asleep in the house. Whether it's having a movie night in the main room of the house, being involved with philanthropy, or going out at night, being in a fraternity was much different than what I expected it to be.

    <h3>How I Would Expect I'd perform in a Full MLB Season</h3>

    <p>Now, if I were performing with my current body, I would genuinely expect that I would only get at best a couple of hits on the season, purely based on luck. However, I will change that by using PEDs like I was prime Barry Bonds. Objectively speaking, I still have the skill of someone who hasn't played an organized baseball game since I was in the fifth grade. So I would have to project at least 200 strikeouts, maybe even break the single-season record for most strikeouts in a season. With the current state of today's pitching, I would be extremely afraid of any fastballs going over 100 miles per hour towards anywhere near my body. This would lead to me also taking several balls across the season, so I would at last have some form of getting to base purely off balls. Along with the presence of breaking balls, it would take extreme luck even to be able to get a hit past the major league-level infielders that would be in front of me. Taking all of this into account, I have made a chart based on what I believe my batting average, total hits, strikeouts, and bases on balls would be in the first three months of an MLB season.
